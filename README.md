- **Django Cart**: Manages the shopping cart functionality.
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computations, primarily for handling data arrays.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Implements content-based filtering algorithms.
- **NLTK**: Processes and tokenizes text data for better recommendation accuracy.

## How It Works

**Content-Based Filtering**: 
- The recommendation engine uses content-based filtering to suggest items similar to the one the user is currently viewing. This is achieved by analyzing item features and calculating similarity scores with other products using Scikit-Learn.
- **Recommendation Logic**: Based on the selected item, the system identifies five items with the highest similarity scores, which are then presented as recommendations.

## Libraries Used

- **Django**: Backend framework.
- **Django Cart**: Cart functionality.
- **NumPy**: Array manipulation for efficient data handling.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Similarity calculations for recommendation engine.
- **NLTK**: Text preprocessing for handling item descriptions and metadata.

## Future Improvements
